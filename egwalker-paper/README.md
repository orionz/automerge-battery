This folder contains all the editing traces benchmarked as part of this work.

The raw editing traces we used are present in DT (raw event graph) format in the raw/ folder. The `node_nodecc` and `git-makefile` traces present there were generated using the `dt git-import` command from the git repositories for nodejs and git, respectively.

The data files in this directory are all derived from the traces in raw/.

See the top level README.md for details on how to generate these files.
